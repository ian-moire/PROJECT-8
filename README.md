# Male Health & Fertility Trends in Kenya
## Background
Kenya has undergone significant demographic and health transitions over the past decades, influencing key aspects of reproductive health, sexual behavior, and healthcare access. The data extracted from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) provides insights into men’s reproductive preferences, sexual activity trends, and circumcision rates across different survey years.

## Objectives
1. Identify patterns in men's desire for children across survey years.

2. Examine trends in recent sexual activity and abstinence among men.

3. Assess circumcision rates and their implications on public health strategies.

4. Provide actionable insights for policymakers and healthcare practitioners.

## Research Questions
1. How has the desire for more children among men in Kenya evolved over time?

2. What trends are observed in recent sexual activity among men across different age groups?

3. What factors influence circumcision rates among Kenyan men, and how do they vary regionally?

4. How can this dataset inform reproductive health interventions and policy recommendations?

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this analysis is the "mens-fertility-and-family-planning_national_ken" dataset from `Data.Humdata.org`. It contains 855 records with features  such as 'ISO3','DataId','Indicator','Value','Precision','DHS_CountryCode','CountryName','SurveyYear','SurveyId','IndicatorId','IndicatorOrder', 'IsTotal', 'IsPreferred','SurveyType', 'DenominatorWeighted',and 'DenominatorUnweighted'. Missing values, duplicates, and outliers were addressed as Feature engineering metrics like ratios, and percentages features were added in the dataset.

## Methodology
The analysis involves the following:
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Filtering relevant indicators, handling missing values, and ensuring consistency across survey years.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Using summary statistics to highlight trends in reproductive preferences and sexual activity.
3. **Visualization:** Creating histograms, scatter plots, and time-series comparisons using Tableau for clearer insights.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Creating percentage-based features. Calculating ratios for comparisons.

## Significance
This study provides valuable insights into men’s reproductive and sexual behaviors, helping policymakers craft informed strategies around family planning, sexual health education, and circumcision-related health initiatives. The findings contribute to ongoing efforts to enhance healthcare accessibility, and disease prevention in Kenya.

## Summary of Key Findings
1. Desire for more children has fluctuated, with noticeable shifts in preferences over time.

2. Recent sexual activity trends highlight changes in behavior, with variations in abstinence rates and engagement levels.

3. Circumcision prevalence remains high, reinforcing its role in public health initiatives.

4. Survey data consistency ensures reliability for policy discussions and health programming.

## Implications
The findings inform healthcare and policy interventions in Kenya by guiding reproductive health strategies tailored to evolving family planning preferences, enhancing sexual health education, ensuring outreach aligns with behavioral trends, strengthening circumcision-based health initiatives in disease prevention and community health efforts.

## Limitations
Limited to socio-demographic breakdowns, restricting deeper sub-group analyses, potential self-reporting bias, particularly in sensitive topics like sexual activity, survey inconsistencies, as methodologies may differ across years, affecting comparisons.

## Future Work
Include regional datasets for more localized insights into reproductive health trends, explore deeper socio-economic correlations, linking indicators to education, income, and healthcare accessibility and enhance predictive modeling using machine learning.
